# SBOM

We get a .json file which appears to be some kind of machine configuration. Look through each key value directory in the components section.

After looking through everything you will see something quite familiar.

While not directly a normal THAINNOS{...} flag, it still works, since the challenge says that the flag format is different for this challenge. (to prevent people from just Ctrl + F'ing)

Input this familiar string as the flag and you solved this challenge!
