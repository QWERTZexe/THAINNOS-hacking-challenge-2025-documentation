# Caption Me If You Can

We get a file with timestamps. And a "weird" v:4EyWrC41Oc4.

If you watched a lot of youtube, you probably know a youtube link looks something like this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ


you see the similarity with the v? So what would happen if we used the v from the file as a youtube url:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EyWrC41Oc4

This video actually exists and even is hacking related!

Now get the video transcript from youtube. You will see the transcript has a timestamp for each sentence. For each timestamp in the file, get the first letter from the sentence of that timestamp. Put it all together and you have the flag.
