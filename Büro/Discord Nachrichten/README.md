# Discord Nachrichten

We have an image of 2 people talking on discord.

One of them uses 3 emojis. Emojis can be typed as text on discord, for example, :wave: would convert to ðŸ‘‹

Get the text representation of these 3 emojis and put it inside the [flag format](https://github.com/QWERTZexe/THAINNOS-hacking-challenge-2025-documentation/blob/main/README.md).
