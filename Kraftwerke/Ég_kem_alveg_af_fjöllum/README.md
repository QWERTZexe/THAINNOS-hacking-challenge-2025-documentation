# Ég_kem_alveg_af_fjöllum

This challenge is an OSINT challenge.

Read through the challenge description: Elfis took this picture somewhere and forgot where, this means, the flag must be the place of the image. The place is probably in iceland since the challenge is written in icelandic.

Now, remove the sheep, the horses and the text from the image, they are useless.

You should now have something like:
[True image](https://github.com/QWERTZexe/THAINNOS-hacking-challenge-2025-documentation/blob/main/Kraftwerke/Ég_kem_alveg_af_fjöllum/true_image.jpg)

Use any image search (e.g. Google) and you will find the name of this place.

Put it inside the [flag format](https://github.com/QWERTZexe/THAINNOS-hacking-challenge-2025-documentation/blob/main/README.md) and you solved the challenge.


## Side-facts:
- The title of the challenge means "I come from the mountains", yet another hint to iceland

- The text on the image is a icelandic saying translating to "Soak your head" which means to chill out and not act too fast
