# Passwoerter

You get a list of usernames and their hashed passwords. 

The challenge description hints at the hashes being whirlpool hashes ("Im wirbelnden Schwimmbad")

Looking at the hint of the challenge, we can see that we need the password for the user named "BouncingKoala".

Unhash this password (google the hash and you will find it)

Put the unhashed password inside the [flag format](https://github.com/QWERTZexe/THAINNOS-hacking-challenge-2025-documentation/blob/main/README.md) and you solved the challenge.
