# White Hats Rise

Nothing is better than a great song!

But just at the beginning and at the end of the song we can hear something unnatural.

Analyze the audio file with Audacity (might need to convert the .mp4 to .wav) and switch to spectogram mode. 

You will see the flag in form of spectogram lines at the places the music sounds unnatural.
